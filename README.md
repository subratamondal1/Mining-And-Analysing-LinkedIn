## The Machine Learning Worklflow ([CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/))
The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that serves as the base for a data science process. It has six sequential phases:

1. **Business understanding** – What does the business need?
2. **Data understanding** – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
3. **Data preparation** – How do we organize the data for modeling?
4. **Modeling** – What modeling techniques should we apply?
5. **Evaluation** – Which model best meets the business objectives?
6. **Deployment** – How do stakeholders access the results?</br>


Published in 1999 to standardize data mining processes across industries, it has since become the most common methodology for data mining, analytics, and data science projects.

Data science teams that combine a loose implementation of CRISP-DM with overarching team-based agile project management approaches will likely see the best results.
## 1. Business Understanding
Mining and Analyzing LinkedIn data. The key areas that will be focused are :
1. Connections between users
2. Invitations between users
3. Generating fake data 
4. Natural Language Processing on the messages</br>

`Note:` Data extracted from the LinkedIn API will be fake to maintain privacy.
